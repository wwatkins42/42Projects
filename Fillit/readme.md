# Fillit

_This is a project allowing you to discover and/or get used to a recurrent problematic in programmation: the search of an_
_optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, in a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be_
_about the arrangement of Tetriminos between them and determine the smallest square able to contain them._

_A Tetriminos is a geometric figure formed from 4 blocks that you know thanks to the famous game Tetris._
