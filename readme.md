# 42 Projects (C)

_Github repository for projects done at school 42 in C._

__Install repository:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42Projects`

Projects are written as such and can contain visually disturbing code atrocities due to a beast called 'La norme' which is
a strict rulebook that learns us how to cleanly code at first and restrict greatly our freedom in the long term.

__Sample from the norm:__
> - Each function must have a maximum of 25 lines.
> - Each line cannot have more than 80 columns, commentary included. Warning: a tab does not count
> as a column but instead the n spaces it represents.
> - Only one instruction per line.
> - Only one variable declaration per line.
> - We cannot make a declaration and instantiation on the same line, at the exception of global variables and static variables.
> - You are forbidden to use:
>   - for
>   - do...while
>   - switch
>   - case
>   - goto
> - Each operator (binary or ternary) and operand must be separated by a single space.
> - etc... (the rule list goes on for 6 pages).
